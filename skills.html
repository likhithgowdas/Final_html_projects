      />HTML5
    </dt>
    <dd>
      HTML5 (Hypertext Markup Language 5) is a markup language used for
      structuring and presenting hypertext documents on the World Wide Web. It
      was the fifth and final[4] major HTML version that is now a retired World
      Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The current specification is
      known as the HTML Living Standard. It is maintained by the Web Hypertext
      Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), a consortium of the major
      browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft). HTML5 was first
      released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008,[2] with a major
      update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014.[5][6] Its goals
      were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and
      other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans
      and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers,
      parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible
      with older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4 but also
      XHTML1 and even the DOM Level 2 HTML itself.[7]

      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing
      the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML
      or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside
      HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation of
      presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.

      />JAVA
    </dt>
    <dd>
      Java is a high-level, general-purpose, memory-safe, object-oriented
      programming language. It is intended to let programmers write once, run
      anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all
      platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[18] Java
      applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java
      virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
      The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level
      facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic
      capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are
      typically not available in traditional compiled languages. Java gained
      popularity shortly after its release, and has been a popular programming
      language since then.[19] Java was the third most popular programming
      language in 2022 according to GitHub.[20] Although still widely popular,
      there has been a gradual decline in use of Java in recent years with other
      languages using JVM gaining popularity.[21]
